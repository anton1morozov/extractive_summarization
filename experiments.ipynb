training examples for each class, making it challenging to scale.\", \"Here, we propose FearNet for incremental class learning.\", \"FearNet is a generative model that does not store previous examples, making it memory efficient.\", \"FearNet uses a brain-inspired dual-memory system in which new memories are consolidated from a network for recent memories inspired by the mammalian hippocampal complex to a network for long-term storage inspired by medial prefrontal cortex.\", \"Memory consolidation is inspired by mechanisms that occur during sleep.\", \"FearNet also uses a module inspired by the basolateral amygdala for determining which memory system to use for recall.  \", \"FearNet achieves state-of-the-art performance at incremental class learning on image (CIFAR-100, CUB-200) and audio classification (AudioSet) benchmarks.\\\\n\", \"In incremental classification, an agent must sequentially learn to classify training examples, without necessarily having the ability to re-study previously seen examples.\", \"While deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized machine perception BID26 , off-the-shelf DNNs cannot incrementally learn classes due to catastrophic forgetting.\", \"Catastrophic forgetting is a phenomenon in which a DNN completely fails to learn new data without forgetting much of its previously learned knowledge BID29 .\", \"While methods have been developed to try and mitigate catastrophic forgetting, as shown in BID23 , these methods are not sufficient and perform poorly on larger datasets.\", \"In this paper, we propose FearNet, a brain-inspired system for incrementally learning categories that significantly outperforms previous methods.\", \"The standard way for dealing with catastrophic forgetting in DNNs is to avoid it altogether by mixing new training examples with old ones and completely re-training the model offline.\", \"For large datasets, this may require weeks of time, and it is not a scalable solution.\", \"An ideal incremental learning system would be able to assimilate new information without the need to store the entire training dataset.\", \"A major application for incremental learning includes real-time operation on-board embedded platforms that have limited computing power, storage, and memory, e.g., smart toys, smartphone applications, and robots.\", \"For example, a toy robot may need to learn to recognize objects within its local environment and of interest to its owner.\", \"Using cloud computing to overcome these resource limitations may pose privacy risks and may not be scalable to a large number of embedded devices.\", \"A better solution is on-device incremental learning, which requires the model to use less storage and computational power.\", \"In this paper, we propose an incremental learning framework called FearNet (see Fig. 1 ).\", \"FearNet has three brain-inspired sub-systems: 1) a recent memory system for quick recall, 2) a memory system for long-term storage, and 3) a sub-system that determines which memory system to use for a particular example.\", \"FearNet mitigates catastrophic forgetting by consolidating recent memories into long-term storage using pseudorehearsal BID34 .\", \"Pseudorehearsal allows the network to revisit previous memories during incremental training without the need to store previous training examples, which is more memory efficient.\", \"Figure 1: FearNet consists of three braininspired modules based on 1) mPFC (longterm storage), 2) HC (recent storage), and 3) BLA for determining whether to use mPFC or HC for recall.\", \"Problem Formulation:\", \"Here, incremental class learning consists of T study-sessions.\", \"At time t, the learner receives a batch of data B t , which contains N t labeled training samples, i.e., B t = {(x j , y j )} Nt j=1 , where x j \\\\u2208 R d is the input feature vector to be classified and y j is its corresponding label.\", \"The number of training

generative autoencoder for pseudorehearsal, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting by generating previously learned examples that are replayed alongside novel information during consolidation.\", \"This process does not involve storing previous training data.3.\", \"FearNet achieves state-of-the-art results on large image and audio datasets with a relatively small memory footprint, demonstrating how dual-memory models can be scaled.\", \"Catastrophic forgetting in DNNs occurs due to the plasticity-stability dilemma BID0 .\", \"If the network is too plastic, older memories will quickly be overwritten; however, if the network is too stable, it is unable to learn new data.\", \"This problem was recognized almost 30 years ago BID29 BID14 , methods developed in the 1980s and 1990s are extensively discussed, and French argued that mitigating catastrophic forgetting would require having two separate memory centers: one for the long-term storage of older memories and another to quickly process new information as it comes in.\", \"He also theorized that this type of dual-memory system would be capable of consolidating memories from the fast learning memory center to longterm storage.\", \"Catastrophic forgetting often occurs when a system is trained on non-iid data.\", \"One strategy for reducing this phenomenon is to mix old examples with new examples, which simulates iid conditions.\", \"For example, if the system learns ten classes in a study session and then needs to learn 10 new classes in a later study session, one solution could be to mix examples from the first study session into the later study session.\", \"This method is known as rehearsal, and it is one of the earliest methods for reducing catastrophic forgetting BID22 .\", \"Rehearsal essentially uses an external memory to strengthen the model\\'s representations for examples learned previously, so that they are not overwritten when learning data from new classes.\", \"Rehearsal reduces forgetting, but performance is still worse than offline models.\", \"Moreover, rehearsal requires storing all of the training data.\", \"BID34 argued that storing of training examples was inefficient and of \\\\\"little interest,\\\\\" so he introduced pseudorehearsal.\", \"Rather than replaying past training data, in pseudorehearsal, the algorithm generates new examples for a given class.\", \"In BID34 , this was done by creating random input vectors, having the network assign them a label, and then mixing them into the new training data.\", \"This idea was revived in BID8 , where a generative autoencoder was used to create pseudo-examples for unsupervised incremental learning.\", \"This method inspired FearNet\\'s approach to memory consolidation.\", \"Pseudorehearsal is related to memory replay that occurs in mammalian brains, which involves reactivation of recently encoded memories in HC so that they can be integrated into long-term storage in mPFC BID31 .Recently there has been renewed interest in solving catastrophic forgetting in supervised learning.\", \"Many new methods are designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting when each study session contains a permuted version of the entire training dataset (see BID20 ).\", \"Unlike incremental class learning, all labels are contained in each study session.\", \"PathNet uses an evolutionary algorithm to find the optimal path through a large DNN, and then freezes the weights along that path BID11 .\", \"It assumes all classes are seen in each study session, and it is not capable of incremental class

work poorly at incremental class learning in BID23 .The Fixed Expansion Layer (FEL) model mitigates catastrophic forgetting by using sparse updates BID6 .\", \"FEL uses two hidden layers, where the second hidden layer (i.e., the FEL layer) has connectivity constraints.\", \"The FEL layer is much larger than the first hidden layer, is sparsely populated with excitatory and inhibitory weights, and is not updated during training.\", \"This limits learning of dense shared representations, which reduces the risk of learning interfering with old memories.\", \"FEL requires a large number of units to work well BID23 .\", \"Figure 2: iCaRL\\'s performance depends heavily on the number of exemplars per class (EPC) that it stores.\", \"Reducing EPC from 20 (blue) to 1 (red) severely impairs its ability to recall older information.\", \"Gepperth & Karaoguz (2016) introduced a new approach for incremental learning, which we call GeppNet.\", \"GeppNet uses a self-organizing map (SOM) to reorganize the input onto a two-dimensional lattice.\", \"This serves as a long-term memory, which is fed into a simple linear layer for classification.\", \"After the SOM is initialized, it can only be updated if the input is sufficiently novel.\", \"This prevents the model from forgetting older data too quickly.\", \"GeppNet also uses rehearsal using all previous training data.\", \"A variant of GeppNet, GeppNet+STM, uses a fixed-size memory buffer to store novel examples.\", \"When this buffer is full, it replaces the oldest example.\", \"During pre-defined intervals, the buffer is used to train the model.\", \"GeppNet+STM is better at retaining base-knowledge since it only trains during its consolidation phase, but the STM-free version learns new data better because it updates the

learning.\", \"During a study session, iCaRL updates a DNN using the study session\\'s data and a set of J stored examples from earlier sessions (J = 2, 000 for CIFAR-100 in their paper), which is a kind of rehearsal.\", \"After a study session, the J examples retained are carefully chosen using herding.\", \"After learning the entire dataset, iCaRL has retained J/T exemplars per class (e.g., J/T

evidence for the dual-memory model.\", \"One of the major reasons why HC is thought to be responsible for recent memories is that if HC is bilaterally destroyed, then anterograde amnesia occurs with old memories for semantic information preserved.\", \"One mechanism HC may use to facilitate creating new memories is adult neurogenesis.\", \"This occurs in HC\\'s dentate gyrus BID2 BID9 .\", \"The new neurons have higher initial plasticity, but it reduces as time progresses BID7 .In contrast, mPFC is responsible for the recall of remote (long-term) memories BID4 .\", \"BID39 and BID15 showed that mPFC plays a strong role in memory consolidation during REM sleep.\", \"BID28 and BID10 theorized that, during sleep, HC reactivates recent memories to prevent forgetting which causes these recent memories to replay in mPFC as well, with dreams possibly being caused by this process.\", \"After memories are transferred from HC to mPFC, evidence suggests that corresponding memory in HC is erased (Poe, 2017).Recently, BID25 performed contextual fear conditioning (CFC) experiments in mice to trace the formation and consolidation of recent memories to long-term storage.\", \"CFC experiments involve shocking mice while subjecting them to various visual stimuli (i.e., colored lights).\", \"They found that BLA, which is responsible for regulating the brain\\'s fear response, would shift where it retrieved the corresponding memory from (HC or mPFC) as that memory was consolidated over time.\", \"FearNet follows the memory consolidation theory proposed by BID25 .\",

      "(CNN) -- Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami-Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.\n",
